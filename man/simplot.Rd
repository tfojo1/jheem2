\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more jheem.simulation.set objects and at most one character vector of outcomes (as an alternative to the 'outcomes' argument)}

\item{outcomes}{A character vector of which simulation outcomes to plot}

\item{corresponding.data.outcomes}{Specify directly which data outcomes should be plotted against simulation outcomes. Must be NULL or a character vector with outcomes as names; all of those outcomes must be present in either the 'outcomes' argument or in '...'"}

\item{split.by}{At most one dimension}

\item{facet.by}{Any number of dimensions but cannot include the split.by dimension}

\item{plot.which}{Should simulation data and calibration data be plotted ('sim.and.data'), or only simulation data ('sim.only')}

\item{title}{NULL or a single, non-NA character value. If "location", the location of the first provided simset (if any) will be used for the title.}

\item{data.manager}{The data.manager from which to draw real-world data for the plots}

\item{style.manager}{We are going to have to define this down the road. It's going to govern how we do lines and sizes and colors. For now, just hard code those in, and we'll circle back to it}

\item{show.data.pull.error}{Not finding data does not block the plot from showing simulation projections, but if you'd like to see in error when data doesn't appear, set this to TRUE.}

\details{
Returns a ggplot object:
 - With one panel for each combination of outcome x facet.by
 - x-axis is year
 - y-axis is outcome
}
