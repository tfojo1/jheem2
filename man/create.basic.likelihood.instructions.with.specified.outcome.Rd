create.basic.likelihood.instructions.with.specified.outcome(
  outcome.for.sim,
  outcome.value,
  from.year,
  to.year,
  omit.years = NULL,
  correlation.different.years = 0.5,

}
\arguments{
\item{outcome.for.sim}{A single character vector specifying the simulation outcome to use.}

\item{outcome.value}{A single, non-NA numeric value that is the value of the outcome at the totals level (i.e., not stratified).}

\item{from.year}{-Inf or a single integer value specifying the earliest year for which data should be pulled.}

\item{to.year}{Inf or a single integer value specifying the latest year for which data should be pulled.}

\item{omit.years}{(Optional) An integer vector of years to ignore.}

\item{correlation.different.years}{A single numeric value specifying the correlation between observations of different years.}

\item{observation.correlation.form}{Which correlation form to use in building the measurement error covariance matrix. May be 'compound.symmetry' or 'autoregressive.1'.}

\item{error.variance.term}{If applicable for the 'error.variance.type' used, a single numeric value. If the 'error.variance.type' is 'function.sd', then this term should be a function that takes arguments 'data' and 'details' and returns a numeric array of the same dimensions as ‘data’, with no NA values, that represents the sd for each measurement in data.}

\item{error.variance.type}{A single character value specifying how the error variance is described. May refer to a single quantity with "sd" (standard deviation), "variance", "cv" (covariance); or may request the error variance be sourced from data with "data.sd", "data.variance", and "data.ci" (confidence interval). The error variance may be specified with more nuance if set to 'function.sd' (see description in 'error.variance.term' definition).}

\item{weights}{A list containing only numeric vectors and objects of class 'jheem.likelihood.weights', which are generated by \code{\link{create.likelihood.weights}}}

\item{equalize.weight.by.year}{A Boolean indicating whether every year should be weighted equally before the weights from 'weights' are applied.}
