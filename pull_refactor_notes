Today's task is a no mapping-needed fraction pull. I want one that uses population just because I already cleared that one.

I can pull counts like "adult.population" when no aggregation is needed.

I've been trying to save the variables used in the pull to test the helpers externally.

I need this so that I can complete the recursive pulls used by fractions or other metrics.

But the next step is to do aggregation of simple counts.

I've made the helper that does mapping for fractions be the same as the one that does aggregation for fractions.

Amazing! I've now made it so it can aggregate counts!!

Next time, I'll continue by working with a proportion pull that needs no aggregate but uses a simple count as denominator,
like adult population as denominator. I'll start with NO mapping needed, then perhaps find a way to make a non-trivial map used.
